# JavaFx Convolutional Network
This project demonstrates the implementation of a JavaFx front end and a convolutional network back end.
The front end interface allows the user to create various network scenarios without modifying the code.
The back end code includes network layers, activation functions, a matrix library, and json utilities. 

See JavaFX-Convolutional-Network.docx for more information.
